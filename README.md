 Common to many science fiction stories, a mad scientist might remove a person's brain from the body,
 suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its neurons by wires to a supercomputer 
 which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives.
 The computer would then be simulating reality  and the "disembodied" brain would continue to have perfectly 
 normal conscious experiences.
